        </h3>
        <p>On Friday the 23<sup>rd</sup> of August, 2024,<br />
          we'll be delivering 50 <span class="color-four">sandwiches</span>, this way:</p>
        <p>This sandwich features 12-hour slow-cooked Argentinian beef, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese sauce, and
          steak sauce in a sesame roll. <br />
          Since the last version, I’ve made a better cheese sauce, which is stronger and
          stickier, improved my steak sauce (the video shows it a bit thin, but you’ll get the proper thick one), and
          perfected the beef’s cooking process.</p>
        <p><b class="color-five">€9.50</b> <span class="color-three">per css</span> (delivery €2.50)

            <span class="color-three">Beef Selection:</span>
            <p>
              I use <a href="https://devesa.com/">Devesa</a>, one of the best beef brands I’ve ever had, sourced
              directly from Argentina. For this sandwich, I choose the chuck. It is char-grilled for about 20 minutes
              and then slow-cooked for 12 hours, seasoned only with salt and pepper, before being set aside for service.
              Each sandwich includes a minimum of 200g of this delicious meat.

            <span class="color-four">Caramelized Onions:</span>
            <p>
              I use one entire white onion per sandwich, pan-fried for 2 hours. Initially, they are cooked without any
              oil, just a bit of salt, and finished with some extra virgin olive oil.
            </p>

            <span class="color-five">Cheddar Cheese Sauce:</span>
            <p>
              A cheddar sauce is made with two kinds of cheddar cheese, cream, milk, cornflour, mustard powder, and
              salt.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="color-four">Steak Sauce:</span>
            <p>
              My steak sauce is a homemade mayo, with Montreal steak seasoning added. It’s a secret recipe, but you get
              the idea.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="color-three">Sesame Roll:</span>
            <p>
              I use a sesame roll baked fresh daily from Zorbas.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="color-four">Assembly:</span>
            <p>
              The steak and half the cheese sauce go into a pan to melt and bind together, served in the roll covered in
              the steak sauce, topped with the rest of the cheese and onions, wrapped twice in wax paper, and delivered
              to you in under 30 minutes (I hope).
